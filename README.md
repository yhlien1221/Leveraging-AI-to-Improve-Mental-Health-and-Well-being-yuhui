# Leveraging AI to Improve Mental Health and Well-being

This repository contains work contributed to the [Omdena Chapter Challenge](https://www.omdena.com/chapter-challenges/leveraging-ai-to-improve-mental-health-and-well-being), a collaborative AI project focused on building AI-powered solutions that provide continuous, personalized, and stigma-free mental health support.

## Project Overview

- Goal: To create AI-powered solutions for mental health and well-being that are personalized, continuous, and free of stigma. The project is inspired by the Gross National Happiness (GNH) philosophy of Bhutan.

- Key Activities: The project involves collecting and analyzing mental health data, developing AI models for personalized support (e.g., symptom tracking and wellness recommendations), and validating the models' effectiveness through user feedback. The ultimate aim is to deploy a platform for real-time mental health support that can adapt to users' needs.


## Project Tasks

The project was divided into multiple tasks.

- **Task 1: Discovery & Definition**
  - Define project scope and requirements with stakeholders.
  - Identify key constraints and review current systems.
  
- **Task 2: Prototype Development & Initial AI Model Testing**
  - Explore and prototype AI models for mental health recommendations.
  - Integrate real-time constraints and test with initial data.
  - Establish key performance metrics and conduct preliminary testing.
  
- **Task 3: Model Refinement & Iterative Testing**
  - Refine the model based on feedback.
  - Optimize for scalability and real-time recommendations.
  - Test with larger datasets and iterate on model performance.

- **Task 4: Final Integration, Deployment, & Reporting**
  - Prepare and deliver comprehensive documentation.
  - Deploy the final AI-powered solution.
