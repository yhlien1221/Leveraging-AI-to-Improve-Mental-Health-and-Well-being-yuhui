# Leveraging AI to Improve Mental Health and Well-being

This repository contains work contributed to the [Omdena Chapter Challenge](https://www.omdena.com/chapter-challenges/leveraging-ai-to-improve-mental-health-and-well-being), a collaborative AI project focused on building AI-powered solutions that provide continuous, personalized, and stigma-free mental health support.

## Project Goals

The main goals of this project are:

- 1. Data Collection and Exploration: Collect and explore diverse mental health-related data.
- 2. Data Processing and Analysis: Process and analyze data to identify patterns and insights related to mental health conditions such as anxiety, depression, and stress.
- 3. AI Model Development: Develop AI-driven models to provide personalized mental health support, including symptom tracking, coping strategies, and wellness recommendations.
- 4. Validation and Evaluation: Validate the effectiveness of the AI models through user feedback and ongoing performance analysis.
- 5. Deployment and Monitoring: Deploy and monitor the platform to ensure continuous, real-time support for users.

## Project Tasks

The project was divided into multiple tasks. This repository includes contributions primarily related to:

- **Task 1: Discovery & Definition**
  - Define project scope and requirements with stakeholders.
  - Identify key constraints and review current systems.
  
- **Task 2: Prototype Development & Initial AI Model Testing**
  - Explore and prototype AI models for mental health recommendations.
  - Integrate real-time constraints and test with initial data.
  - Establish key performance metrics and conduct preliminary testing.
  
- **Task 3: Model Refinement & Iterative Testing**
  - Refine the model based on feedback.
  - Optimize for scalability and real-time recommendations.
  - Test with larger datasets and iterate on model performance.

- **Task 4: Final Integration, Deployment, & Reporting**
  - Prepare and deliver comprehensive documentation.
  - Deploy the final AI-powered solution.
