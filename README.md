## Description

Building an AI-powered solutions that provide continuous, personalized, and stigma-free mental health support. The solutions will ensure scalability to reach underserved populations while addressing challenges like data privacy, ethical use, bias elimination, and maintaining clinical effectiveness.

## Challenge Background

Rooted in Bhutan’s development philosophy of Gross National Happiness (GNH), which values a holistic and sustainable approach that reflects the country’s commitment to inclusive and compassionate innovation. In this challenge, we aim to build AI-powered solutions that provide continuous, personalized, and stigma-free mental health support. These solutions will ensure scalability to reach underserved populations while addressing challenges like data privacy, ethical use, bias elimination, and maintaining clinical effectiveness. While mental health is a growing global priority, this platform offers an opportunity to explore solutions that resonate universally, yet remain adaptable to diverse cultural and societal contexts. Bhutan sees this challenge as a timely and meaningful step toward contributing to global efforts while nurturing systems that align with its own values of well-being and equity.

## The Problem

Mental health challenges are a growing global concern, with millions of individuals facing issues such as anxiety, depression, stress, and burnout. Despite advancements in healthcare, access to mental health resources remains limited due to barriers such as stigma, high costs, and a shortage of trained professionals. Additionally, existing solutions often lack personalization, making it difficult to provide effective, timely, and scalable support to those in need. 

Artificial Intelligence (AI), offers transformative potential to address these challenges. AI-powered solutions can provide continuous, personalized, and stigma-free support while ensuring scalability to reach disadvantaged populations. However, the implementation of AI in mental health is not without challenges, such as ensuring ethical use, data privacy, bias elimination, and maintaining clinical effectiveness.

## Goals of the project

- Collect and explore diverse mental health-related data
- Process and analyze data to identify patterns and insights related to mental health conditions such as anxiety, depression, and stress.
- Develop AI-driven models to provide personalized mental health support, including symptom tracking, coping strategies, and wellness recommendations.
- Validate the effectiveness of AI models through user feedback and ongoing performance analysis to ensure accuracy and reliability.
- Deploy and monitor the platform to ensure continuous, real-time support for users, adapting to their evolving mental health needs.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Have a Look at the project structure and folder overview below to understand where to store/upload your contribution
- If you're creating a task, Go to the task folder and create a new folder with the below naming convention and add a README.md with task details and goals to help other contributors understand
    - Task Folder Naming Convention : *task-n-taskname.(n is the task number)* ex: task-1-data-analysis, task-2-model-deployment etc.
    - Create a README.md with a table containing information table about all contributions for the task.
- If you're contributing for a task, please make sure to store in relavant location and update the README.md information table with your contribution details.
- Make sure your File names(jupyter notebooks, python files, data sheet file names etc) has proper naming to help others in easily identifing them.
- Please restrict yourself from creating unnessesary folders other than in 'tasks' folder (as above mentioned naming convention) to avoid confusion.
